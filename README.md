# LightGBMLSS - An extension of LightGBM to probabilistic modelling and prediction
We introduce a comprehensive framework that models and predicts the full conditional distribution of a univariate target as a function of covariate. Choosing from a wide range of continuous, discrete, and mixed discrete-continuous distributions, modelling and predicting the entire conditional distribution greatly enhances the flexibility of LightGBM, as it allows to create probabilistic forecasts from which prediction intervals and quantiles of interest can be derived.

## Features
:white_check_mark: Estimation of all distributional parameters. <br/>
:white_check_mark: Normalizing Flows allow modelling of complex and multi-modal distributions. <br/>
:white_check_mark: Zero-Adjusted and Zero-Inflated Distributions for modelling excess of zeros in the data. <br/>
:white_check_mark: Automatic derivation of Gradients and Hessian of all distributional parameters using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/autograd.html). <br/>
:white_check_mark: Automated hyper-parameter search, including pruning, is done via [Optuna](https://optuna.org/). <br/>
:white_check_mark: The output of LightGBMLSS is explained using [SHapley Additive exPlanations](https://github.com/dsgibbons/shap). <br/>
:white_check_mark: LightGBMLSS provides full compatibility with all the features and functionality of LightGBM. <br/>
:white_check_mark: LightGBMLSS is available in Python. <br/>
